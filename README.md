# Tidy Process - Instruction list used to tidy the data
1. Step 1 - Merge the data sets creating one data set with training data, test data and subjects. The variables of the data set were named acordingly to the features data set.
2. Step 2 - Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Subset only variable names containing MEAN and STD, case insensitive.
3. Step 3 - Name the activities based on descriptive activity names data set.
4. Step 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Replace the invalid characters from the variable name for an underscore, so the variable names are ready to be used in R.
5. Step 5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Sumarise the mean by subject and activity to all variables in the merged data set.
